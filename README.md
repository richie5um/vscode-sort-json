# VSCode SortJSON

## What is it?

Alphabetically sorts the keys in _selected_ JSON objects.

> **Please take care using this** - I've tried to ensure it won't invalidate your JSON. But, as it has to parse > sort > stringify, there is a chance it'll lose something. It should be fine for plain JSON.

## Install

- Install via VSCode extensions install

## Usage

- Select a JSON object (note, it uses full lines so ensure the selected lines are a valid JSON object)
- Run the extension (Cmd+Shift+P => Sort JSON)

### Context Menu

If there are too many entries in the Context Menu, then you can modify which get shown by adding (and editing) this to your VSCode preferences:

    "sortJSON.contextMenu": {
        "sortJSON": false,
        "sortJSONAlphaNum": false,
        "sortJSONAlphaNumReverse": false,
        "sortJSONKeyLength": false,
        "sortJSONKeyLengthReverse": false,
        "sortJSONReverse": false,
        "sortJSONType": false,
        "sortJSONTypeReverse": false,
        "sortJSONValues": false,
        "sortJSONValuesReverse": false
    }

## Settings

- You can override the sort order (note: this applies to all levels and overrides reverse sort too). Add this to your preferences (settings.json):
  - `"sortJSON.orderOverride": ["name", "version", "description"]`
- You can underride the sort order (note: this applies to all levels and underrides reverse sort too). Add this to your preferences (settings.json):
  - `"sortJSON.orderUnderride": ["dependencies", "devDependencies"]`

### Sort on save

There's a vscode setting for formatters (`settings.json`):

```json
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true
  }
```

But you can also selectively enable/disable this formatter with (`settings.json`):

```json
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.sortJSON": true
  }
}
```

Or use a hotkey, if you prefer (`keybindings.json`):

```json
{
  "key": "cmd+shift+a",
  "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
  "args": {
      "kind": "source.fixAll.sortJSON"
  }
}
```
